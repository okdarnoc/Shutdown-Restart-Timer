# Shutdown/Restart Timer

This program allows you to schedule a shutdown or restart of your Windows computer after a specified duration. It provides a convenient way to automate the shutdown or restart process without manually monitoring the time.

## Mechanism

The program is written in Python and utilizes the `os` module to execute system commands. It calculates the number of seconds based on the specified duration in minutes and triggers the shutdown or restart command using the `os.system()` function.

## Use Case

The shutdown/restart timer can be useful in various scenarios, such as:

- **Scheduled computer shutdown**: If you want your computer to automatically turn off after a certain period, you can use this program to schedule a shutdown. For example, you may want your computer to shut down after a long download or rendering process completes.
- **Automated system restart**: Sometimes, it's necessary to restart your computer to apply system updates or changes. You can set a timer using this program to restart your computer at a specific time, allowing you to step away and let the restart occur automatically.
- **Power management**: By scheduling shutdowns, you can optimize power usage and minimize energy consumption, especially when your computer is not in use.

## Usage

To use the shutdown/restart timer:

1. Ensure that Python is installed on your Windows computer.
2. Download the `shutdowntimer.py` file from this repository.
3. Open a command prompt and navigate to the directory where `shutdowntimer.py` is located.
4. Run the script by entering `python shutdowntimer.py`.
5. Enter the number of minutes until the shutdown or restart and specify the action (shutdown or restart).
6. Press Enter and the program will initiate the countdown.

Please note that this script may require administrative privileges to perform the shutdown or restart action. Use it with caution as it can cause your system to shut down or restart abruptly.

For more information and customization options, refer to the script's comments and documentation.
